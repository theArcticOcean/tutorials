The Qin Dynasty became a powerful empire from a small state after the Reforms of Shang Yang. The new rules rewarded farmers and soldiers if they meet the government policies, punishment the people who broken the law even if he is a prince in the land, freed convicts who work hard for agriculture, and encouraged the immigration of farmers from other states into Qin.

The king of state Qin took in the people from the Zhou Dynasty, left the original land for them to live, but used the Yang’s rules to manage them.

A servant named Lu Zhi who served the royal family of Zhou Dynasty was good at knitting and embroidery. The prince of Zhou Dynasty Ji Heng fell in love with the girl. He asked her to make love with him, but Lu Zhi begged for freedom before that or she would refuse it.

One day the family went for a walk in the country in spring, Ji Heng followed Lu Zhi for one day and asked for it again. Lu Zhi wanted the prince to give her freedom, Ji heng promised to the girl and got what he wanted. Lu Zhi begged for a valuable item to prove her freedom from the family, but Ji Heng didn’t respond to her and slept deeply. Lu Zhi was very sham and regretted what had happened, she suicided right next to him.
